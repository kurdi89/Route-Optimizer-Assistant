üìå Updated Database Schema with Persistent User Instructions for Optimization

I‚Äôve added a new column to the ai_settings table to store persistent user-defined instructions for route optimization. These instructions allow users to specify constraints such as avoiding highways, limiting fleet capacity per trip, prioritizing certain customers, or preferring shortest vs. fastest routes.

üìå Updated Database Schema Overview

The updated schema allows users to input persistent optimization rules, ensuring AI considers their preferences when generating routes.

üìå Updated Table: ai_settings

This table now includes a column for persistent instructions.

Column Name	Data Type	Description
id	INTEGER (PK)	Auto-incrementing unique setting ID
model_for_conversation	TEXT	LLM model selected for chat (mistral-7b, gemma-7b, llama-3, etc.)
model_for_reasoning	TEXT	LLM model selected for processing logic (deepseek-coder, gpt-4, etc.)
model_for_optimization	TEXT	LLM model selected for route optimization (mixtral, claude-3-haiku, etc.)
persistent_instructions	TEXT	JSON or TEXT storing user-defined rules (e.g., "avoid_highways": true, "max_orders_per_fleet_x": 5")
last_updated	DATETIME	Timestamp when settings were last modified

üìå How Persistent Instructions Work
	1.	User enters rules in the settings menu
	‚Ä¢	Example:
	‚Ä¢	Avoid highways
	‚Ä¢	Limit Fleet-X to 5 orders per trip
	‚Ä¢	Prioritize VIP customers first
	‚Ä¢	Prefer shortest route over fastest route
	‚Ä¢	Group orders by region
	2.	System stores these rules in ai_settings.persistent_instructions
	‚Ä¢	Stored in JSON format for easy processing.
	‚Ä¢	Example JSON structure:

{
  "avoid_highways": true,
  "max_orders_per_fleet_x": 5,
  "priority_customers": ["Customer A", "Customer B"],
  "route_preference": "shortest"
}


	3.	Route Optimization Model Reads These Rules Before Generating Routes
	‚Ä¢	When optimizing routes, the AI will always check these rules before making decisions.
	‚Ä¢	Example Impact:
	‚Ä¢	If avoid_highways = true, routes will be generated using only city roads.
	‚Ä¢	If max_orders_per_fleet_x = 5, fleet X won‚Äôt be assigned more than 5 orders.
	4.	Users Can Update Instructions Anytime
	‚Ä¢	Changes take effect immediately for all future route generations.

üìå Summary of Enhancements
	‚Ä¢	Users can now define persistent rules that AI follows always during route optimization.
	‚Ä¢	Stored in ai_settings.persistent_instructions in JSON format.
	‚Ä¢	Rules dynamically impact how routes are created, making AI customizable to business needs.
	‚Ä¢	Flexible for future expansion (e.g., new constraints like ‚Äúavoid toll roads‚Äù or ‚Äúprefer early deliveries‚Äù).

üöÄ This makes the system more powerful, user-friendly, and adaptable to real-world logistics constraints! üòä


üìå Configuration Side Menu - Full Details

The configuration side menu is a critical feature of your route optimization app, allowing users to customize settings, choose AI models, define optimization rules, and tweak parameters that affect how deliveries are planned.

It consists of multiple sections that give users full control over the AI‚Äôs behavior, fleet settings, map display, and optimization constraints.

üìå Sections of the Configuration Menu

1Ô∏è‚É£ AI & Model Selection

This section allows the user to choose which AI models will handle different tasks. Since multiple models can be used for different aspects, users can select the best model for each.

Option	Description	Example Choices

Group Orders by Region	Ensure orders in the same area are grouped into the same trips.	true/false
Avoid Highways	Prevents AI from suggesting highway routes.	true/false
Avoid Toll Roads	Avoids routes that have toll fees.	true/false
Delivery Time Window	Define the range when deliveries can be made.	8 AM - 6 PM

üîπ How it Works:
	‚Ä¢	The AI will always consider these rules when planning routes.
	‚Ä¢	Users can dynamically update constraints, and the AI will recalculate trips instantly.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Fleet & Vehicle Settings

This section allows users to configure details about their fleet, such as vehicle capacity and availability.

Option	Description	Example Values
Number of Available Vehicles	How many fleet vehicles are in operation today.	10, 20, 50
Vehicle Capacity (per trip)	Maximum number of items a vehicle can carry.	100 kg, 200 kg, 500 kg
Vehicle Type Preference	Select different vehicle types for different trip requirements.	Vans, Trucks, Motorcycles
Fuel Efficiency Consideration	Whether AI should optimize for fuel efficiency.	true/false

üîπ Why is this important?
	‚Ä¢	Helps the AI assign orders to the best-suited vehicles.
	‚Ä¢	Avoids overloading or underutilizing fleet capacity.

4Ô∏è‚É£ User Preferences & Custom Rules

Users can set persistent instructions that AI will always follow when optimizing routes.

Persistent AI Instructions	Custom rules users want AI to follow every time.	"Always limit Fleet-X to 5 orders"
Preferred Route Strategy	Users can choose how AI calculates routes.	Shortest, Fastest, Balanced
Blacklisted Areas/Zones	Areas where deliveries should not be planned.	"Industrial Zone 5", "Traffic Congested Area"

üîπ Example Persistent Instruction:
	‚Ä¢	"Always avoid downtown during rush hours (7-9 AM & 4-6 PM)."
	‚Ä¢	"Prioritize VIP customers before standard customers."

This ensures the AI remembers user-defined strategies for every new route.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Map Display Options

Since the app features a map on the left, users can control how data is displayed.

Option	Description	Example Values
Show Routes on Map	Toggle visibility of route paths.	true/false
Label Routes by Fleet Number	Display fleet numbers on map routes.	true/false
Color Code Trips	Assign different colors to different trips.	true/false
Show Traffic Conditions	Overlay real-time traffic data.	true/false
Show Vehicle Live Location	Track fleet vehicles in real-times.	true/false

üîπ Why is this useful?
	‚Ä¢	Helps dispatchers visualize routes in real time.
	‚Ä¢	Allows quick adjustments to trips based on traffic and delays.

üìå Final Thoughts

This configuration menu makes the AI highly flexible and customizable, allowing users to control every aspect of route planning, fleet management, and AI decision-making.

# Chat Interactions : 
here is how the chat interactions should work : 

1. the user will be able to ask for the routes for the day :
- generate the routes for the day based on the optimization settings and the persistent instructions
- the user can ask for the routes for the day by fleet 
- the user can ask for the status of the routes for the day 
- the user can ask for the routes for the day by fleet 
- the user can ask for the status of the routes for the day by fleet

system should respond with (in sequensed steps and replies) : 
- ok let me help you with that 
- let me check the routes for the day, I can see that you have X fleets available today 
- I can see you have X orders to deliver today
- let me start by generating the routes for the day based on the optimization settings and the persistent instructions
- I can see that your custom instructions X and to do Y
- let me try cluster the orders by region and see if I can find the best routes for the day
- confirming on the stock levels for the day 
- let me check the orders for the day, I can see that you have X orders to deliver today
- let me check the orders for the day by fleet 
- let me check the status of the orders for the day 
- let me check the status of the orders for the day by fleet
- I am building the routes for the day based on the optimization settings and the persistent instructions
- here is the most efficient routes for the day based on given instructions for each fleet by outlet

then shows the on the maps and gives the user the option to view a table of routes with the following details : 
- fleet number
- outlet name
- address
- estimated time of arrival
- status
- distance
- duration
- route
- route details
- route instructions
- route map
- route summary
- list of orders in the route
- list of orders in the route by fleet
- sequence of the route
